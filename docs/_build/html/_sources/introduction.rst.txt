Introduction
============

Metric Query Library is a Rust-based Python extension module for querying and transforming metrics data. It provides high-performance operations for working with time series data, with a focus on efficiency and ease of use.

The library is built using Rust for performance-critical operations, with Python bindings provided through maturin. This hybrid approach allows for the speed of Rust with the flexibility and ease of use of Python.

Key Features
-----------

* High-performance metric querying and transformation
* Support for labeled metrics
* Flexible filtering and aggregation operations
* Seamless integration with Python applications
* Comprehensive API for working with time series data

Architecture
-----------

The library consists of:

* A core Rust implementation for performance-critical operations
* Python bindings generated using maturin
* A Python API layer for easy integration with Python applications
* Flask-based REST API for web applications
